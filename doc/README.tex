%%%%%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
\emph{Iron Legends} is a top-down arcade-style tank combat game. The goal is simple: total domination! Players will strap themselves into the cockpit of a tank and blast, smash, and detonate anyone and everyone who dares to stand in their way. With two different modes of gameplay–--single-player and networked multiplayer--–combatants can pit their wits and their bravery against legions of computer-controlled tanks or test their mettle against friend and foe alike. Let the mayhem begin!
