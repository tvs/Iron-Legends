CS 447/547: Computer Game Design Project 2: Iron Legends
================================================================================

Iron Legends is an unrestrictive two-dimensional shooter where players
are placed in control of a tank and let free to cause as much havoc as
possible. That said, depending on the mode of gameplay, single-player or
networked multiplayer, there are certain objectives that dictate the win
scenario.

In the single-player game mode, various types of computer-controlled enemies
will roam the battlefield trying to destroy the player. In order for the
player to win, s/he must annihilate each of the enemies. To even the odds,
each defeated enemy will have a chance to drop a power-up for the player's
tank. For example, power-ups may include: increased speed, increased armor,
or even weapons with different behaviors.

In multiplayer mode, the objective is different. Players are placed on
teams and given an unlimited number of lives. Instead of being the last tank
standing, the teams are required to destroy an enemy base while protecting
their own. There is one catch; when destroyed, the player will suffer some
negative effect, either by losing points from their score or by losing their
accumulated power-ups.

       * Made simple client/server Java application (though it is not included in the game)
     * AI
       * Research
       * In this version only one behavior of the AI tank is completed, that is
         ability to chase the target once the target is within certain range.    

 (3) Meeting low bar goals
     Following features are still in development that was proposed as low bar goals:
       * Multiple map
